"sometimes when using grid search or randomized search one has the necessity to enable or disable some preprocessing steps . for example , i might decide to see whether my model performs better if i scale my features or not .  i think a simple way to obtain that would be to add a ` bypass ` argument to the transformers .  as an example , think of a setup where a idtid40 logisticregression idtid0 model is selected through grid search :   phofcode   given this setup , whenever the combination of parameters contains ` bypass=true ` , the scaling is ignored , regardless of the value of the other parameter ` idtid40 with_std idtid0 ` . i also think this is pretty easy to implement . for example , ` idtid40 standardscaler idtid0 ` could be extended by just changing its ` idtid40 __init__ idtid0 ` and ` fit ` methods like this :   phofcode   not totally sure if i 'm being clear with this request , if you do n't understand i can provide a working example , since i 've implemented it for my own personal use .
